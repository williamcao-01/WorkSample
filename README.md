The visualization compares the number of internet users in China and US starting from 2000 to 2016. The message is straight forward. Although the internet user in US is significantly higher than China’s in 2000. The pivot point happened in 2008. Since 2005, the internet user in China rapid expanded and exceeded US in 2008. Until 2016, China’s number triples what US have. This graph can present the growth in China’s internet usage and growth in the past 10 years.

The animation helps to visualize the time series of the presented information. With the cumulative display, the difference in growth is easily presented.

The main focus of the story is the comparison between China and US. Therefore, I used color darkened orange for China, representing its confidence and positivity, dark grey for US as a more balanced growth. Font choice is Arial. A few testing with New Times Roman and other fonts were tries. This chosen san serif font gives a light theme for the readers to receive the message and read the text. And it presents itself well on the graph. Minimal theme is chosen to eliminate unnecessary chunks in the graph. The legend is moved to bottom to fully present the width of the graph. Both x and y scales are customized to showcase the minimum needed information.
